  Check this option to preselect the option that allows local release artifacts during the release build in the Trigger Unleash Maven Plugin view.<br>
  This means that the release build will not fail if the release artifacts are yet present in the local repository. Nevertheless the remote repositories are checked for release artifacts an the release build will fail if one of the artifacts is already present there.
