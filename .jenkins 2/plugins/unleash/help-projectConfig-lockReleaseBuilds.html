<div>
  Set the number of successful release builds that shall be locked in the build history.<br>
  <ul>
    <li>Setting <tt>0</tt> won't lock any of the release builds so that the history may not contain the latest release.</li>
    <li>Any value below <tt>0</tt>, f.i. <tt>-1</tt> will lock all release builds.</li>
    <li>Any positive value determines a concrete number of release builds to lock.</li>
