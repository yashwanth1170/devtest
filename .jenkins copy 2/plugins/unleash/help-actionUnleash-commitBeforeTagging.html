  If this option is checked a SCM commit will be created prior to the creation of the SCM tag. This commit will have the release versions set for all modules.<br>
  If this option is not checked no commit will be created which means that the tag will be created from the checked-out working copy. This has the advantage that incoming commits prior to the tag creation cannot disturb the release process.
