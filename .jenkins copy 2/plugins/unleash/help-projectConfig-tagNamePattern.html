<div>
  Specify a pattern for names of the tags that are created during the release build.<br><br>
  <b>Variable expansion</b><br>
  It is also possible to use a limited set of variables that will be expanded during tag name calculation.<br>
  Variables are referenced with <tt>@{VAR_NAME}</tt>.<br>
  The current implementation provides the following variables that can be used (but this is subject to change):
  <tt>
    <ul>
      <li>@{project.groupId}</li>
      <li>@{project.artifactId}</li>
      <li>@{project.version}</li>
    </ul>
  </tt>
